I'm a third year Ph.D. student in the School of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University. My advisors are Prof. Weiguo Gao and Prof. [Yingzhou Li](https://yingzhouli.com/). I obtained my bachelor degree in 2022, from the School of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University.

I'm also an enthusiast of running. My half marathon PB is 1:41:18 at the Shaoxing Marathon in 2024 and my marathon PB is 4:19:28 at the Nantong Marathon in 2025.

## Research Interest

* Hierarchical matrix and its applications;
* Fast algorithms for elliptic PDEs;
* Non-uniform discrete Fourier transform;
* Randomized numerical linear algebra.
